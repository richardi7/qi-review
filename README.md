Review of QI package in R

This is an ongoing exercise in understanding which are the best libraries to use for undertaking Statisitcal Process Control in R. 
It reflects my approach in adopting a automated pragmatic view of using SPC to detect variation in situations where there are a large number of processes that would require too much human intervention to review individually. 
I have added a new script that apllies Chris Readings https://github.com/chrisreading01/SPCwizard rules to the output from John Mackintosh's  https://github.com/johnmackintosh/spccharter.  It creates a verbose data frame with the points indentified that meet the outlier specification.
You can then chart this to your requirements

Please contribute any issues or improvement

Review of QI package in R

This is an ongoing exercise in understanding which are the best libraries to use for undertaking Statisitcal Process Control in R. 
It reflects my approach in adopting a automated pragmatic view of using SPC to detect variation in situations where there are a large number of processes that would require too much human intervention to review individually. 

Please review, comment and contribute to the debate to help move this forward.
